## Leaflet Step 1
Using the Javascript library Leaflet, this map shows earthquakes for the past 7 days.  The earthquake data is accessed via the USGS GeoJSON feed.  Each earthquake is plotted on the map with the size corresponsding to the magnitude and the color corresponding to the depth.  Click on each circle for a pop-up of the location, magnitude, and depth.  

## Leaflet Step 2
In addition to the earthquake data, this map also shows the tectonic plate boudaries.  The legend is interactive and allows the user to toggle on or off the earthquake markers and the tectonic plate lines.  The user can also choose which type of map to show: grayscale, satellite, or street maps.
